## Project Brief
**External User’s Goal**: The user seeks accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health, including how to recognize common issues and manage stress, presented in a supportive and organised layout.

**Site Owner’s Goal**: The site owner wants to create a welcoming webpage that provides basic mental health information using a clean and supportive design. The focus is on using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a calming and well-organised user experience.

**Potential Features might Include**:
- Hero Section with Positive Messaging: A Bootstrap Jumbotron with an encouraging message about mental health, using a calming colour scheme and a simple background image.
- Information Cards: Use Bootstrap’s card components to present mental health tips and common issues, providing a visually appealing way to organise content.
Resource Links: A grid layout for external links to mental health resources styled with Bootstrap buttons to make them stand out.
- Positive Affirmations: Use Bootstrap’s text utilities to include a section with uplifting quotes or messages to encourage users.

## Wireframing

I used the desktop application Balsamiq to create my wireframes for the project.

## Testing

I used the W3C Markup validation service to check that my HTML was valid, there were no issues raised.

I also did the same with the CSS validator tool, again no errors were found.

I thenused Lighthouse (Google Pagespeed Insights) to test how well my website would run in a browser based on performance (93), accessibility (100), best practices (100) and SEO (100).

I was happy with the overall results of the test, the reason why the performace was only at 93/100 was due to the fact that I used some external images for the stories section as I had linked to some stories that were real on another website and used their images, these were the images that brought this specific score down. If it had been lower than 90/100 then I would have considered hosting those images within Github Pages, however I didn't feel that was necessariry at this point.

## Deployment
Throught the build of the project I was using GitHub to store my repository and regularly pushing my code. When it was completed I utilised GitHub Pages to host the website itself.
